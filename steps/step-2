3 - Create the webpack.config.js file and write basic config code.
4 - Build our code using webpack
5 - Verify the dist folder with generated content.
6 - Add NPM Scripts to build and run.

---------------------------------------
Tasks
1 - Change basic config to test the single entry file, check generated code.
